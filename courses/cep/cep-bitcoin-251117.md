#### Course Description

The first deployment of a blockchain was in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. While enterprises have embraced the blockchain, Bitcoin is primarily thought of as a speculative investment. As most blockchain systems have copied one or more aspects of Bitcoin, there is merit in understanding how it works. This one day course will introduce Bitcoin and describe its blockchain implementation. The role of Bitcoin mining in controlling coin creation and achieving consensus regarding blockchain state will be discussed. The Bitcoin transaction format, scripting language, and smart contracts will also be described.
