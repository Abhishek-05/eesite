\begin{questions}
\question[5] Consider a variant of the one-time pad with message space $\mathcal = \{0,1\}^l$ and keyspace $\mathcal{K}$ restricted to all $l$-bit strings with an even number of $1$'s. Is this scheme perfectly secret? Justify your answer either with a proof or a counterexample.

  \question[5] State whether the following encryption scheme is perfectly secret or not. Justify your answer either with a proof or a counterexample.

  The message space is $\mathcal{M} = \left\{ m \in \{0,1\}^l \mid \textrm{the last bit of $m$ is 0} \right\}$. Algorith \texttt{Gen} chooses a uniform key from the keyspace $\{0,1\}^{l-1}$. $\texttt{Enc}_k(m) = m \oplus (k \| 0)$ and $\texttt{Dec}_k(c) = c \oplus (k \| 0)$.
